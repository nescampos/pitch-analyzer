# Pitch Analyzer

Pitch Analyzer is a web app built with Python, Streamlit, LangChain and CAMEL to generate dialogs between a startup founder and a VC investor for a specific pitch. The idea of this project is to prepare founders on the types of questions after a pitch at events, in order to improve their arguments and get feedback.
